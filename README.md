## GasGuard: Automated Optimization Suite

### 1. Executive Summary

**GasGuard** is an open-source static analysis tool built to secure the Stellar ecosystem (Soroban) and extended to support Ethereum and other L2s.. By identifying inefficient storage patterns and redundant operations during the development phase, GasGuard enables developers to ship leaner code, reducing end-user transaction costs by an estimated **15-30%**.

### 2. The Problem

As Web3 scales, transaction costs remain a barrier to entry. Many developers use legacy patterns that result in "bloated" contracts. Existing tools are often too complex for junior devs or lack specific support for newer environments like **Soroban (Stellar)** or **Optimism**.

### 3. Our Solution & Key Features

* **Static Analysis:** Scans code for common gas-heavy patterns (e.g., inefficient loops, unoptimized storage slots).
* **Auto-Refactor Suggestions:** Provides "Copy-Paste" ready code snippets to replace inefficient logic.
* **CI/CD Integration:** A GitHub Action that runs every time code is pushed, ensuring no "gas regressions" are introduced.
* **Educational Tooltips:** Every suggestion includes a link to documentation explaining *why* the change saves money, fostering developer growth.

### 4. Why This Project belongs in Drips Wave

* **Scalability:** The tool is modular; we plan to add support for 3 new languages (Rust, Vyper, Move) over the next 6 months.
* **Public Good:** The core engine will remain 100% free and MIT-licensed forever.
* **Sustainability:** We use Drips to "pass through" 15% of our funding to the underlying security libraries (like Slither or Cargo-Audit) that our engine utilizes.

### 5. Roadmap for this Wave

* **Phase 1:** Complete the CLI tool for local developer use.
* **Phase 2:** Launch the GitHub Action Marketplace integration.
* **Phase 3:** Establish a "Community Ruleset" where users can contribute their own optimization patterns via PRs.
